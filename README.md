# Buzz Killfeed
![main](https://github.com/shannonwells/BuzzKillfeed/actions/workflows/elixir.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)


## ClickbaitGenerator rewritten in Elixir/Phoenix
This rewrite will include some features I've been meaning to implement for awhile:

* seasonal themes and related words.
* A "Fill in the Bait" game that visitors can play alone or with friends.  
    Generate your own headines by filling in some blanks and submit to get the hilarious result.
* Improved styling and behavior
* Better and more ways to share favorites
* Tracking views - by view count only, no session storage - so "Best Of" list can be shown.
* Updated words and phrases
* More family-friendly.

The fresh, new, amazing version is not yet released.

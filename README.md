## ClickbaitGenerator rewritten in Elixir/Phoenix
This rewrite includes some features I've been meaning to implement for awhile:

* seasonal themes and related words.
* A "Fill in the Bait" game that visitors can play alone or with friends.  
    Generate your own headines by filling in some blanks and submit to get the hilarious result.
* Improved styling and behavior
* Better and more ways to share favorites
* Tracking views - by view count only, no session storage - so "Best Of" list can be shown.
* Updated words and phrases
* More family-friendly.

## _However_...
While I implemented most of the above, and it was in fact deployed for a time, the rewrite experience 
after a 2 year hiatus looking at Elixir/Phoenix was a nightmare. The process was so frustrating, slow,
and the lack of support and updates made me so angry I want to do _another_ rewrite rather than dealing 
with this code base again.

Furthermore, Heroku made it increasingly difficult to keep my app deployed so I stopped giving them $7 a month
to fail at hosting my app.  Stay tuned.
